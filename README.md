# Day of the Week Calculator

## Introduction
The **Zeller's Congruence Formula** is a mathematical algorithm used to calculate the day of the week for any date. This Readme file provides an overview of the software application that has been developed to implement this formula using C programming language. 

## System Requirements
- Operating System: Any operating system that supports C programming language.
- Compiler: A C compiler such as GCC.
- Development Environment: A text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or DevC++.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project from the repository.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/day-of-the-week.git
   ```

2. Open the project in the desired text editor or C IDE.

## Usage
1. Open the main.c file, where the implementation of Zeller's Congruence Formula is available.

2. Provide the desired date inputs in the `day`, `month`, and `year` variables declared within the main function.

   ```c
   int day = 12;      // Set the desired day
   int month = 6;     // Set the desired month
   int year = 2022;   // Set the desired year
   ```

3. Run the program to execute Zeller's Congruence Formula and calculate the day of the week for the provided date.

4. The program will display the result, indicating the day of the week for the provided date.

   ```
   The day of the week for 12th June 2022 is: Sunday
   ```
